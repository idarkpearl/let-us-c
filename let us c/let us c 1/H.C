        b = a%10; no// the function is used so that we can get the smallest last digit of the number//
        c = c*10 + b;// not the initial value of C is zero, so like we get reminder, Three now see multiplied by 10 is equal to 0+3 is three, so the New value of C is three now for the next Digit, let's say it is five. We know that three is the value of C so it is going to 3Ã—10 is 30+ remainder will be four so it is going to be 34 now, and it will continue to grow like this.//
        a = a/10;// it is used to get digits of the number. For example, like we get last date, then again, we get the second last third last fourth last.//
